## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-17

**Headline:** ~93 % porcelain coverage. 0.6.9 covered the structural gaps (worktrees, submodules, subtrees); 0.7.0 finishes the surface area with the eight commands a vanilla `git` user expects to find. Also pulls the existing names into plainer English where it didn't break git habits.

### Added (top-level)

- **`torii bisect`** — binary-search the commit that introduced a regression. Subcommands `start / bad / good / skip / reset / log / run <cmd>`. State-machine wrapper over `git bisect` (libgit2 has no bisect primitives).
- **`torii describe`** — pretty name for HEAD based on the nearest tag, e.g. `v0.6.9-3-gabc1234`. Flags `--tags / --long / --dirty / --candidates N`.
- **`torii archive`** — export a tree or commit as tarball/zip. Wrapper over `git archive` to inherit decades of format edge-cases.
- **`torii remove`** (alias `rm`) — remove tracked files from index and working tree. Flags `--cached / -r / --force`.
- **`torii rename`** (alias `mv`) — rename/move tracked files; both filesystem and index updated atomically. `--force` to overwrite.
- **`torii grep`** — search tracked content for a pattern. Wrapper over `git grep` (faster than ripgrep on tracked-only content; different concern from `torii scan`).
- **`torii notes`** — annotations on commits stored in `refs/notes/commits`. Subcommands `list / add / append / show / edit / copy / remove`.
- **`torii patch`** — export commit ranges as `.patch` files (`export`) and apply them as new commits (`apply`). Wrappers over `git format-patch` / `git am` with `--3way / --continue / --abort / --skip` plumbed through.
- **`torii clean`** — remove untracked files (≡ `git clean`). Defaults to dry-run for safety. `-f / -d / -x / -X` flags.

### Added (extensions to existing commands)

- **`torii tag push --force`** — finally a way to force-push a single tag (or all tags) from torii without falling back to `git`. Refspec gets the standard `+oldref:newref` prefix on the wire.
- **`torii submodule update --recursive`** and **`torii submodule add --recursive`** — descend into nested submodules so `update` mirrors `git submodule update --init --recursive` when both flags are passed.
- **`torii worktree lock`** / **`unlock`** / **`move`** / **`repair`** — fills in the rest of `git worktree` parity. `move` patches both the `.git` link inside the worktree and the `.git/worktrees/<name>/gitdir` admin file by hand because libgit2 has no `worktree_move`.
- **`torii snapshot apply / pop / drop / clear / show`** — completes the `git stash` family on top of the existing `stash` / `unstash`. `apply` and `pop` are aliases of `unstash --keep` / `unstash` for users coming from git. `clear` deletes all snapshots (asks unless `--yes`); `show` prints metadata + bundle contents.
- **`torii status --tracked` (`-z` for NUL-separated)** — `git ls-files` equivalent. Walks the index and prints every tracked file.
- **`torii remote refs <target>` (`--heads / --tags`)** — `git ls-remote` equivalent. Hits the network using configured auth.

### Renamed (with aliases — old names still work, prints deprecation in some cases)

- **`torii history clean` → `torii history compact`** (alias `gc`). "GC" is jargon, "compact" reads. `clean` (history) → deprecated alias with warning; will be removed in 0.8. Frees up the word `clean` for the new top-level untracked-cleanup command.
- **`torii history fsck` → `torii history orphans`** (alias `fsck`). "fsck" is hostile Unix-filesystem jargon; "orphans" describes exactly what the command finds.
- **`torii rm` → `torii remove`** (alias `rm`). Plain English first, `rm` kept for muscle memory.
- **`torii mv` → `torii rename`** (alias `mv`). "rename" is more accurate than "move" 95 % of the time and friendlier; `mv` kept for muscle memory.

### Deprecated

- **`torii blame <file>`** → use `torii show <file> --blame` (already existed; was a duplicate top-level). Old form prints a warning and still works through 0.7.x; will be removed in 0.8.
- **`torii history clean`** → use `torii history compact` (or alias `gc`). Old form prints a warning.

### Notes

- **`torii notes` and `torii bisect`** intentionally wrap their git counterparts rather than reimplementing on top of libgit2. The state machines and edge-case handling involved (mailbox parsing, BISECT_* file ceremony, notes-tree merge semantics) are decades-refined upstream; reimplementing them would be 1k+ LOC of risk for behaviour already correct.
- **Out of 0.7.0, deferred to 0.7.1:**
  - `cargo-dist` installer setup — the README still mentions a `gitorii-installer.sh` that no CI generates. Tracked.
  - GPG re-sign during `torii history reauthor` / `mailmap apply` — needs libgit2 `commit_signed` callback wiring + a real key in tests. Documented limitation since 0.6.7.
- **`rust-toolchain.toml` stays pinned at 1.94.0.** rustc 1.96 (with the mono-partitioning ICE fix) is currently in beta with a stable release expected in ~11 days; we'll validate against it then and unpin.

### Porcelain coverage

After 0.7.0, gitorii covers **~93 %** of git porcelain commands (excluding GUIs and ploumbing). What remains intentionally out:

- `sparse-checkout` (edge case for monorepos),
- `mergetool` / `gui` / `citool` (interactive UIs — `torii tui` occupies that space),
- `range-diff` (rare; comparing commit series),
- `restore` at file-level (parcial via `save --reset`; explicit form pending if asked),
- `shortlog` (parcial via `log --author`).

Nothing structural is missing.

## [0.6.9] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **`torii submodule` — seven-subcommand MVP** for embedding another git repo at a pinned commit inside this one. Mirrors `git submodule` with torii's UX layer on top.
  - **`torii submodule add <url> <path> [--branch <b>] [--name <n>]`** registers the entry in `.gitmodules`+`.git/config`, clones the contents, stages the result, and writes the optional tracking branch. The user finishes the operation with their own commit.
  - **`torii submodule status` (or just `torii submodule`)** lists every submodule with HEAD oid, working-tree oid, URL, and a state string (`clean`, `modified`, `not initialised`, `dirty working tree`, etc.).
  - **`torii submodule init [--force]`** copies `.gitmodules` URLs into `.git/config` so `update` knows where to fetch from. Idempotent.
  - **`torii submodule update [--init]`** fetches and checks out the commit each submodule is pinned at. `--init` runs `init` first for uninitialised entries (mirrors `git submodule update --init`).
  - **`torii submodule sync`** re-copies `.gitmodules` URLs into `.git/config` (useful after an upstream URL change).
  - **`torii submodule foreach <cmd>`** runs `<cmd>` via `$SHELL -c` in each submodule's working directory, exporting `TORII_SUBMODULE_NAME` and `TORII_SUBMODULE_PATH`. Stops at the first non-zero exit (matches `git submodule foreach` default).
  - **`torii submodule remove <path>`** scrubs all four places submodule state lives: `.gitmodules` section, `.git/config` section, `.git/modules/<name>/` cached gitdir, and the super-repo's index (via libgit2 directly — `git rm --cached` refuses when `.gitmodules` already has staged changes; libgit2's index API doesn't care).
- **`torii subtree` — five-subcommand thin wrapper** around `git subtree` for merging another project's history into a subdirectory of this repo. `add`/`pull`/`push`/`split`/`merge`, all forwarding to the upstream contrib script. `--squash` exposed on the operations that support it.
  - Why a wrapper, not a reimplementation: `git subtree` is ~800 lines of bash refined since 2009 with a long tail of edge cases (orphan commits, parent detection, --squash semantics, history rewrites through merge bases). Reimplementing those in Rust on top of libgit2 (no subtree primitives) would be 1k+ LOC of risk. Torii provides the UX skin and clear error message when `git-subtree` is missing.
- **Worktree polish — four follow-ups to 0.6.8:**
  - **`torii worktree` with no subcommand defaults to `list`** (git/cargo/npm convention).
  - **`torii worktree list` now shows ahead/behind vs upstream** when the worktree's branch tracks one. Reads `dirty · 2 ahead, 1 behind` style; silently omits the second segment when there's no upstream (very common for fresh feature branches).
  - **New config key `worktree.inherit_paths`** (comma-separated): paths from the main repo to drop into every freshly-created worktree. Files are copied (real fresh writable copy); directories are symlinked (typically large build caches like `target/` or `node_modules/`); missing entries are silent. Solves the #1 pain of worktrees in practice — no more rebuilding from scratch in every linked checkout.
  - **Snapshot module now handles worktrees correctly.** Previously the pre-remove safety snapshot in `torii worktree remove` failed silently with "Not a directory (os error 20)" because the module assumed `.git` was a directory; in a worktree it's a one-line link file pointing at a shared gitdir in the main repo's `.git/modules/<name>/`. The module now detects the file case, copies the link plus a `RESOLVED-GITDIR` marker, and leaves the shared metadata alone.

### Notes
- **Submodule recursion (`--recursive`)** is intentionally not in 0.6.9; nested submodules need a manual loop for now. Tracked for follow-up.
- **Subtree** depends on `git-subtree` being on PATH. On Arch/Fedora it ships with `git`; on Debian/Ubuntu it's a separate `git-subtree` package. Torii surfaces a precise error message if it's missing.
- **Index manipulation in `submodule remove`** is now done via libgit2 directly (`Index::remove_path`/`remove_dir` + `Index::write`), not by shelling out to `git rm --cached`. The shell-out path stayed brittle in practice because git refuses to operate on the index when `.gitmodules` has uncommitted edits, which is precisely the state we're in mid-remove.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **`torii worktree` — five-subcommand MVP**: linked working copies of the same repository, each on its own branch, sharing the underlying object database. Useful for "let me hot-fix without disturbing my in-progress branch" and similar workflows that `git worktree` covers — with torii ergonomics on top.
  - **`torii worktree add [<path>] [-b <new-branch>] [<existing-branch>]`** creates a new worktree. Path is optional: when omitted it's derived from `worktree.base_dir` (new config key, default `..`) + `<repo>-<branch-sanitized>/`. `-b` creates a branch off HEAD; positional names an existing local branch.
  - **`torii worktree list`** prints every worktree (main + linked) with branch name and clean/dirty status in one shot. `📍` marks the current one; locked worktrees show their lock reason. Faster mental model than the per-worktree text dump from `git worktree list`.
  - **`torii worktree remove <path> [--force] [--no-snapshot]`** deletes a worktree's directory and prunes its libgit2 metadata. Refuses if the working tree is dirty unless `--force`. Always attempts a safety snapshot first (snapshot of the worktree itself, not the main repo). The snapshot may silently fail on worktrees because the existing snapshot module assumes `.git` is a directory and a worktree's `.git` is a link file — graceful warning, removal proceeds. Snapshot module fix tracked for a later release.
  - **`torii worktree prune`** clears metadata for worktrees whose directories were deleted out-of-band (e.g. via `rm -rf`). Only fires on already-invalid entries; never touches live worktrees.
  - **`torii worktree open <path>`** launches `$SHELL` (fallback `/bin/bash`) in the worktree directory and blocks until you exit — same gesture as `(cd <path> && $SHELL)` but rejected if the path isn't a known worktree of the current repo. `git worktree` has no equivalent.
- **New config key `worktree.base_dir`** (default `..`) controls where `torii worktree add` puts new worktrees when no path is provided. Honors `~` expansion. Set with `torii config set worktree.base_dir ~/worktrees` to centralise them.

### Notes
- Lock / unlock / move / repair are intentionally not in 0.6.8; the design review picked an MVP plus `open` as the first cut. Filling them in is a straight-line addition on top of `Worktree::lock`/`unlock` from git2 + path manipulation; pull request welcome.
- Unit tests cover branch-name sanitisation, `~` expansion, worktree-name derivation. Walker tested end-to-end against toy repos: add (new + existing branch), list (with status), remove (clean + dirty + force), prune (stale entries).

## [0.6.7] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **`torii history reauthor --old <id> --new <id>`** — rewrite author identity across reachable history with a single CLI pair. Auto-detects the `--old` format: `"Name <email>"` for full match, a bare email for email-only match, or a bare name for name-only match. The replacement `--new` must always be `"Name <email>"`. Flags: `--committer` (also rewrite committer; default off), `--since <rev>` (limit to a range), `--dry-run` (preview without writing), `--no-snapshot` (skip the automatic safety snapshot), `--allow-dirty` (proceed past uncommitted changes).
- **`torii history mailmap apply [--file <path>]`** — batch identity rewrite driven by a [standard git `.mailmap`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap) at the repo root (or any path). Supports all four mailmap line shapes: `Name <commit-email>`, `<proper-email> <commit-email>`, `Name <proper-email> <commit-email>`, `Name <proper-email> Commit Name <commit-email>`. Shares every flag with `reauthor` (`--since`, `--dry-run`, `--no-snapshot`, `--committer`, `--allow-dirty`).
- **Shared behaviour for both commands**:
  - Safety snapshot (`pre-reauthor-<timestamp>`) taken automatically; revert with `torii snapshot restore <id>`.
  - Annotated-tag taggers are rewritten to match the new identity (not preserved) so tag metadata stays consistent with the rewritten commit.
  - Original author/committer timestamps preserved — only *who* changes, never *when*. Use `torii history rewrite` for dates.
  - Refuses to run if the repository has a pending merge/rebase/cherry-pick or a dirty working tree (override with `--allow-dirty`).
  - HEAD and local branches re-point at the new OIDs; lightweight tags retarget; annotated tags get rebuilt.

### Documentation
- **`COMMANDS.md` adds an "Identity rewrite details" subsection** under `torii history` covering snapshot behaviour, timestamp preservation, GPG-signature invalidation, mailmap format, and the `--force` push needed after rewriting shared branches.
- **`README.md` History section** gains the new commands and a one-paragraph caveat block.

### Build / toolchain
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml` pins `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@1.94.0`** for the `cargo publish` job (was `@stable`). Without this the CI's verify-build step would ICE on rustc 1.95.0 against the russh→rsa-rc chain and the publish would never reach crates.io. Also passes `--locked`, `RUST_MIN_STACK=16777216` and `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2` to mirror the README workarounds for the codegen-pressure path. Revert to `@stable` once upstream rustc fixes the regression.

### Documentation
- **README "Install" expanded** with a fallback to the GitLab Generic Package Registry direct URL (`gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/paskidev%2Fgitorii/packages/generic/gitorii/<tag>/torii-<arch>`). The `gitorii-installer.sh` wrapper referenced in the top install snippet doesn't exist yet — no CI generates it — so users currently hitting the 404 have an explicit working path. `cargo install gitorii --locked` is the new from-source recommendation.
- **README "Known issue" rewritten** to separate the two failure modes (rustc 1.95 ICE vs. LLVM codegen SIGSEGV / stack overflow) and give the concrete flags that resolve each one: `cargo +1.94.0 install gitorii --locked` for the ICE, plus `RUST_MIN_STACK=16777216 ... -j 2` for the codegen path. Adds a third "skip the compiler entirely" path with the GitLab binary URL.

### Known limitations
- **GPG-signed commits**: signatures invalidate after rewrite because they're computed over the original author. Re-sign manually (or set up a key and re-run `torii save --amend` on each commit) — automatic re-signing during rewrite is not yet wired.
- **`gitorii-installer.sh` doesn't exist yet** — README mentions GitHub Releases but no CI generates the wrapper script. Tracked for follow-up (cargo-dist or equivalent). Direct binary download from GitLab works in the meantime; see Install section.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-05-16

### Build / toolchain
- **Pin build toolchain to `rustc 1.94.0` via `rust-toolchain.toml`** to work around a `rustc 1.95.0` ICE in mono-item partitioning. The regression hits the transitive crypto chain (`russh` → `rsa 0.10-rc` → `crypto-bigint 0.7-rc` → `elliptic-curve 0.14-rc`) and surfaces as `Option::unwrap() on a None value` inside the compiler or as SIGSEGV mid-compile. Honoured automatically by `rustup` users — distro-shipped rustc see README "Known issue" for manual workarounds. To be removed when a fixed stable lands.
- **Declare MSRV `rust-version = "1.85"`** in `Cargo.toml`, matching `russh`'s declared minimum. Stops cargo from attempting older toolchains where the transitive deps don't build at all.

### Fixed
- **No more `choose HTTP client (ureq or reqwest)` panic on first command per cache window.** `update-informer 1.3.0` made the HTTP backend feature non-optional; the previous `features = ["crates"]` declaration was enough to compile but landed on a stub that panics at runtime. Now pulls `ureq` (rustls-backed, no extra system deps) alongside `crates`. Reproduced via `torii mirror add gitlab user paskidev gitorii --primary` on a fresh cache.

### Documentation
- **`torii --help` now groups examples by intent** instead of listing nine random one-liners. Five thematic blocks (daily flow / branch & history / repos & identity / release & collaboration / interactive UI) cover the top-level surface and surface previously-hidden commands like `torii status`, `torii diff --staged`, `torii config set`, `torii history rebase`, `torii history scan`, `torii auth login`, `torii tag create`, `torii pr create`, `torii workspace status`, `torii tui`.
- **`COMMANDS.md` gains six previously-undocumented sections**: `torii auth`, `torii workspace`, `torii pr`, `torii issue`, `torii ignore`, `torii tui`. Every example is sourced verbatim from the `after_help` of the matching subcommand so reference and CLI stay in lockstep.
- **`COMMANDS.md` `.toriignore` reference rewritten**: previous text only mentioned `.gitignore` sync and omitted the `[secrets]` / `[size]` / `[hooks]` sections and the machine-private `.toriignore.local` overlay. Now documents the full schema and links to `SECURITY.md` for the hook trust model.
- **`README.md` adds Auth (cloud) / Pull requests / Issues sections** and completes the `torii config` key list (`auth.gitea_token`, `auth.forgejo_token`, `auth.codeberg_token`, `mirror.autofetch_enabled`, `snapshot.auto_interval_minutes`, `ui.date_format` were missing).

## [0.6.3] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **`torii sync --push` no longer reports false success** when libgit2 returns Ok with zero refs ever acknowledged by the server. Common with very large pushes over SSH (3GB+ to GitLab). Errors out with a clear diagnostic suggesting HTTPS+token instead. `sideband_progress` callback wired so `remote: …` server messages reach stderr verbatim.
- **`torii sync --verify` queries the live remote**, not the cached `refs/remotes/origin/*`. Previous behaviour reported "in sync" against an empty remote right after a silently-failed push. Now opens a real connection and lists the actual refs; surfaces "no such ref on remote" when the branch isn't there at all.
- **`torii clone <plat> <user/repo> <path>`** honours the trailing path arg (was silently ignored). Same for `torii clone <url> <path>`. Precedence: `--directory` > positional > derive-from-URL.
- **Empty-clone HEAD points at config'd default branch** (`git.default_branch`, default `main`) instead of libgit2's `master` fallback. Previously, cloning an empty repo whose remote default was `main` left `.git/HEAD` at `refs/heads/master`, breaking the next `torii sync --pull`.
- **`torii clone` accepts `file://`, `git://`, `ssh://`, local paths, Windows drives, and scp-form URLs** via a unified `looks_like_clone_url` parser. Previously `torii clone file:///tmp/src dest` errored "Unknown platform 'file:///tmp/src'".

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Live clone progress.** `torii clone` now redraws every ~100ms with `📥 N% recv/total objects · indexed · MB` and passes server `remote: …` messages through verbatim. Previously cloning a multi-GB repo (servo, chromium) looked frozen for minutes. Set `TORII_CLONE_DEPTH=N` for a shallow fetch.
- HTTPS transport gains `connect_timeout=10s` + request `timeout=300s` (override with `TORII_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECS`). Hung servers no longer freeze torii indefinitely.

### Fixed
- **`torii sync` no longer aborts on a freshly created remote** with `corrupted loose reference file: FETCH_HEAD`. Empty / missing FETCH_HEAD now treated as "nothing to pull".
- **`torii snapshot stash` actually saves working-tree changes** now. Previous impl copied `.git/` and reset `--hard`, silently dropping uncommitted edits because they aren't in `.git/objects` yet. Replaced with libgit2's native `Stash::save / pop`. `unstash` works against `stash@{0}` (default) or any index.
- **`torii remote create gitlab <user>/<repo>`** falls back to GitLab's `/users?username=` lookup when `/groups/<user>` 404s, so personal-namespace creates work alongside group ones.
- **`torii remote delete github`** now uses the GitHub REST API directly instead of shelling out to `gh` (which most users don't have installed). Surfaces clean errors on missing `delete_repo` scope (403) or unknown repo (404).
- **HTTPS auth body trim** (`cloud::short_body`) sliced by bytes, panicking when a server error message contained multi-byte UTF-8 straddling byte 200. Now slices by chars.
- **`torii scan` / `scan --history`** caps blob size at 5MB (override via `TORII_SCAN_MAX_BYTES`) so large generated assets don't OOM the scanner across long histories.

### Security
- **Hooks (`.toriignore [hooks]`) now require explicit one-time trust before executing.** Cloning a hostile repo could otherwise run arbitrary `sh -c …` on the very first `torii save`. On first encounter (or after the command list changes) torii prompts y/N with the commands printed verbatim; trust is persisted to `~/.config/torii/hook-trust.toml` keyed by repo path + command-list hash. Bypass with `TORII_TRUST_HOOKS=1` (CI), `TORII_NO_HOOKS=1` (skip), or `--skip-hooks`. Non-tty + untrusted refuses rather than silently running.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- `torii auth login / status / whoami / logout` — manage gitorii.com API key for cloud features. Stored at `~/.config/torii/auth.toml` (chmod 600). Env override: `TORII_API_KEY`.
- `torii scan --commits` — enforce commit policy from `policies/commits.toml` (forbid/require trailers, forbid subjects, author email regex, length limits, conventional commits). `torii init` scaffolds a default policy.
- `torii history fsck` — recovery aid listing unreachable commits/blobs/trees after a destructive operation. `--show <oid>` prints content; `--restore <oid> --to <path>` writes a blob to disk.
- `torii log --graph` + always-on graph in TUI Log view. Lane-based ASCII rendering with five styles (`ascii`, `curves`, `heavy`, `bubbles`, `bubbles-x`) selectable from Settings.
- `torii remote create` accepts `owner/repo` to target an organization (GitHub/Gitea/Forgejo/Codeberg) or GitLab group/subgroup. Bare names keep current personal-namespace behaviour. `--namespace <OWNER>` flag is the explicit form.

### Changed
- `torii init` now writes default branch as `main` (config-driven via `git.default_branch`, no longer libgit2 default `master`).
- `torii sync --push --force` surfaces server-side rejections (branch protection, pre-receive hook decline) instead of reporting silent success.
- TUI sidebar drops view-switcher hotkeys (`g`, `l`, `b`, etc.) — they conflicted with in-view keys like `g` (graph). Navigation goes through the sidebar tabs.
- Commit policy schema migrated from Gate DSL to plain TOML — drops `gate-lang` dependency, simpler syntax.

### Fixed
- `torii history rebase --todo-file` with `reword` now actually rewrites the message (was silently equivalent to `pick`).
- `torii history rebase --continue / --abort / --skip` after a CLI-initiated `git rebase -i ... edit` pause (libgit2 `open_rebase` doesn't see CLI rebases; we now detect and shell out).
- Selected commit glyph in TUI no longer shrinks under `Modifier::BOLD` (some fonts lack a Regular bold variant for `⦿` etc).
- All compiler warnings (6 → 0) silenced with explicit `#[allow(dead_code)]` + comments.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Pure-Rust HTTPS+SSH transports.** libgit2's libcurl/libssh2 transports replaced by custom impls registered via `git2::transport::register`. HTTPS over `reqwest` + `rustls`, SSH over `russh` + `aws-lc-rs`. Result: **build needs only a C compiler** — no perl, no openssl-dev, no libssh2-dev, no pkg-config.
- HTTPS auth via env vars per host: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `CODEBERG_TOKEN`, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, `GITEA_TOKEN`, `FORGEJO_TOKEN`, `SOURCEHUT_TOKEN`. Generic fallback `TORII_HTTPS_TOKEN`.
- SSH auth chain: ssh-agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) → `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` → `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Failure message lists each method tried.
- SSH host verification via `~/.ssh/known_hosts` (handles hashed entries and `[host]:port`). TOFU prompt on first connection if tty; `TORII_SSH_STRICT=1` to disable TOFU.
- Actionable HTTPS error messages distinguishing 401 (no auth / bad creds), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found / not visible).
- Internal `crate::url::encode` helper (no `urlencoding` dep).

### Fixed
- **Silent push rejections.** `torii sync --push` previously printed `✅ Pushed to remote` even when the server rejected the update (branch protection, non-fast-forward without `--force`, pre-receive hook decline, missing permissions). libgit2's `remote.push()` returns Ok in those cases; rejections only surface via the `push_update_reference` callback. Now collected and reported as `push rejected by remote: <ref> → <reason>`. Bug pre-existed the transport rewrite and affected 0.5.0 too.

### Changed
- **Build deps reduced to just a C compiler.** No `perl`, `openssl-dev`, `libssh2-dev`, `make`, `cmake`. `pkg-config` optional.
- **Runtime deps:** `libz` (zlib) + libc only. No openssl, libssh2, libcurl.
- `git2` builds with `default-features = false` — libgit2 vendored without HTTPS/SSH (`GIT_HTTPS=0 GIT_SSH=0`).
- Bumped `reqwest` 0.11 → 0.12 with `rustls-tls`.
- `clap` pinned to `=4.5` to dodge a 4.6 crash in `Subcommand::augment_subcommands`.
- Direct deps trimmed: 18 → 14 (dropped `tokio` direct, `is-terminal`, `serde_yaml`, `urlencoding`).

### Notes
Validated end-to-end against **GitHub, GitLab, and Codeberg** (HTTPS + SSH, clone/fetch/push). Other forges (Bitbucket, Gitea, Forgejo, Sourcehut, SourceForge) speak the same Smart HTTP / SSH protocol so they should work, but have not been individually verified at push level. Please report issues at https://github.com/paskidev/gitorii/issues.

## [0.6.0-rc.2] - 2026-05-02 (yanked)

### Fixed
- README install/system-dependency sections still listed `perl`, `openssl-dev`, `libssh2-dev` and `pkg-config` from the pre-0.6 era. Updated to reflect that only a C compiler is required from source. Added a section for the `static` feature + musl target that produces a zero-runtime-deps binary. 0.6.0-rc.1 yanked because the README on crates.io misled testers into installing dependencies they no longer need.

## [0.6.0-rc.1] - 2026-05-02 (yanked)

### Added
- **Pure-Rust HTTPS+SSH transports** — libgit2's libcurl/libssh2 transports replaced by custom impls registered via `git2::transport::register`. HTTPS over `reqwest` + `rustls`, SSH over `russh` + `aws-lc-rs`.
- HTTPS auth via env vars per host: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `CODEBERG_TOKEN`, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, `GITEA_TOKEN`, `FORGEJO_TOKEN`, `SOURCEHUT_TOKEN`. Generic fallback `TORII_HTTPS_TOKEN`.
- SSH auth chain: ssh-agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) → `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` → `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Failure message lists each method tried.
- SSH host verification via `~/.ssh/known_hosts` (handles hashed entries and `[host]:port`). TOFU prompt on first connection if tty; `TORII_SSH_STRICT=1` to disable TOFU.
- Actionable HTTPS error messages distinguishing 401 (no auth / bad creds), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found / not visible).
- Internal `crate::url::encode` helper (no `urlencoding` dep).

### Changed
- **Build deps reduced to just a C compiler.** No more `perl`, `openssl-dev`, `libssh2-dev`, `make`, `cmake`. `pkg-config` optional (used to find system libgit2/zlib; falls back to vendored).
- **Runtime deps:** `libz` (zlib) and libc only. No openssl, no libssh2, no libcurl.
- `git2` builds with `default-features = false` — libgit2 vendored without HTTPS/SSH support (`GIT_HTTPS=0 GIT_SSH=0`).
- Bumped `reqwest` 0.11 → 0.12 with `rustls-tls`.
- `clap` pinned to `=4.5` to dodge a 4.6 crash in `Subcommand::augment_subcommands`.
- Direct deps trimmed: 18 → 14 (dropped `tokio` direct, `is-terminal`, `serde_yaml`, `urlencoding`).

### Notes for testers
This is a release candidate. The transport rewrite is a major internal change. Validated against GitHub clone/fetch/push over HTTPS (with token) and SSH (with ed25519 + known_hosts). Other forges (GitLab, Codeberg, Bitbucket, Gitea, Forgejo, Sourcehut) use the same Smart HTTP/SSH protocol so they should work, but have not been individually verified at push level. Please report issues at https://github.com/paskidev/gitorii/issues.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- `.toriignore.local` — machine-private overlay for sensitive ignore rules. Auto-gitignored, never committed. Merges on top of `.toriignore`; tighter local size limits override public ones.
- `torii ignore add|secret|list` — manage rules from the CLI. `secret` defaults to `.local` (private); `--public` writes to committed `.toriignore` with a recon-warning.
- `[secrets]`, `[size]`, `[hooks]` sections in `.toriignore` for declarative pre-save/sync gates (custom regex secret rules, file-size limits, hook commands).
- Update banner in TUI header when a newer crates.io version is available.
- CLI update notifier on crates.io releases.

### Changed
- Command surface tightened: promoted `blame`/`scan`/`cherry-pick` to top-level; demoted `ls`/`unstage`/`repo`; consolidated `mirror primary`/`replica`.

### Fixed
- `torii pull` branch handling, `remote link`, `unstage`, `rebase --root`, `amend` after history rewrite, `branch --orphan`, `save` flag combinations.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Updated LICENSE to TSAL-1.0 (Torii Source-Available License)
- CI pipeline now only triggers on version tags, no branch pipelines

## [0.1.15] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `torii sync`, `torii fetch`, `torii push tags` now authenticate with HTTPS token (gitlab_token, github_token, etc.) — previously only SSH was supported, causing auth failures on HTTPS remotes
- GitLab CI pipeline no longer fails with exit code 22 when release already exists (409 treated as success)
- Pipeline now only triggers on version tags (`vX.Y.Z`), suppressing unwanted branch pipelines

## [0.1.8] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Corrected license metadata in Cargo.toml to reference LICENSE file instead of MIT

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `torii sync --force` and `torii sync --push` now also sync replica mirrors automatically
- Renamed remaining internal `slaves` variable references to `replicas` in mirror output
- Mirror list output now shows `PRIMARY` instead of `MASTER`

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- `torii sync` now automatically pushes to all configured replica mirrors after syncing with origin — no need to run `torii mirror sync` manually

### Fixed
- Removed unused `mut` on `index` variable in rebase loop
- Removed unused `repo_path` variable in `show` command

## [0.1.5] - 2025-04-16

### Fixed
- Full Windows and macOS native compatibility — removed all `HOME` env var hardcoding
- Replaced all `Command::new("git")` subprocesses with native `git2` API calls
- SSH credential resolution now uses `dirs::home_dir()` for cross-platform paths
- Config dir now uses platform-native path via `dirs::config_dir()` (Linux XDG, macOS `~/Library`, Windows `%APPDATA%`)
- `torii snapshot restore` uses git2 hard reset instead of subprocess
- `torii snapshot stash/unstash` uses git2 index and reset instead of subprocess
- `torii history reflog` uses git2 reflog API
- `torii history revert/reset/merge/rebase` fully ported to git2
- Tags pushed via git2 enumeration instead of `git push --tags` subprocess
- `OpenSSL` vendored in `git2` dependency for Windows native builds

### Changed
- `git2` dependency updated to include `vendored-openssl` feature for Windows support

## [0.1.4] - 2025-03-15

### Changed
- Renamed `master`/`slave` mirror terminology to `primary`/`replica` across all commands and output
  - `torii mirror add-master` → `torii mirror add-primary`
  - `torii mirror add-slave` → `torii mirror add-replica`

### Fixed
- Platform-native config path for token storage (was hardcoded to Linux `~/.config`)

## [0.1.3] - 2025-03-01

### Added
- Platform shorthand syntax for `torii clone`: `torii clone github user/repo`
- `torii ls [PATH]` — list tracked files in the index
- `torii show [OBJECT]` — show commit, tag or file details

- Collapsed 7 top-level history-related commands into `torii history` subcommands for a cleaner CLI surface

### Fixed
- Repo URL in Cargo.toml

## [0.1.1] - 2025-02-01

### Added
- `torii history remove-file` — permanently erase a file from the entire git history

### Fixed
- Scanner now detects sensitive filenames (`.env`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa`, etc.)
- Scanner extended with Spanish-language placeholder detection
- Reduced false positives in sensitive data scanner
- Mirror sync now pushes tags alongside branch refs
